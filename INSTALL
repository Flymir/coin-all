CoinAll
=======

The goal of this project is to provide an environment for building a
completely interoperable set of binaries consisting of all COIN-OR projects that
use the COIN-OR configuration and build system.

Below are the standard COIN-OR installation procedures.

**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the CoinAll package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "CoinAll", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/CoinBinary/CoinAll/stable/1.6 CoinAll

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/CoinAll and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip CoinAll-1.5.0.tgz
   tar xvf CoinAll-1.5.0.tar

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

First, if you want to compile Ipopt, you need to make sure that Blas, Lapack
and either Mumps or certain packages from the Harwell subroutine library are
available (see the INSTALL.* files in ThirdParty/*). You must also download
any other optional third party packages before configuration. It is
recommended to download glpk, as this enables additional functionality in a
number of COIN-OR packages.

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g., CoinAll)
and type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of CoinAll successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code in the projects works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples for a Project Prjct in 

   Prjct/examples/

subdirectory (for those, that provide examples), see also the
information at
